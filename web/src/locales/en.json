      "principle": "ARTigo is a collaborative platform and an example of open university research in which you participate as a player. All ARTigo games work like this: You are presented with an image. The goal is to describe this image within a certain time with keywords (<i>tags</i>) in such a way that as many points as possible are scored:",
      "motivation": "After you have played a predefined number of rounds, the metadata for the images become visible. In this way, you not only generate art-historical knowledge, but also collect it. Every tag you enter is saved and improves the search for artworks—a win-win situation. So, go for it!"
