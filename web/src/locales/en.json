          "Art history studies mainly original artworks, but often their reproductions, too. Today, these reproductions exist in substantial electronic repositories sometimes amounting to several million items. What can we do to retrieve these reproductions preferably on the basis of various criteria? As the possibilities of a computerized search of these reproductions are still very limited we allocate keywords, known as metadata. This is a most time-consuming operation and one would need a great number of staff members to do this job. We would appreciate your contribution to this game. However, we don't only want something from you but we offer you as well entertainment and at the same time training as you get to know quite a lot about the paintings shown here. In addition to that, you will be able to work with the descriptions you gave us."

              "ARTigo is an online game with the aim to supply artworks with tags. The same artwork is simultaneously shown to you and a co-player. The game now consists in describing the artwork accurately with tags. A tag can describe what you see on the artwork or remarks on style, quality or emotions. For each artwork, you have 60 seconds for your input. You get points for the tags identical to the ones entered by your co-player or another player in a previous round. The more tags per artwork are matched, the more points you get during the five rounds of the game. Every entered tag is saved and improves the search for artworks. As for the search however, only those tags entered at least twice for an artwork and thus marked in blue are relevant.",
