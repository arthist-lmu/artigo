To search for images in such directories, descriptive texts are needed: a task you can help us with in a playful way—and at the same time learn a lot about art!",
      "principle": "ARTigo is a collaborative platform and an example of open university research in which you participate as a player. All ARTigo games work like this: You are presented with an image. The goal is to describe this image within a certain time with keywords (<i>tags</i>) in such a way that as many points as possible are scored:",
      "scoreValidated": "You get {n} points if the tag for this image was already given in an earlier game round",

      "motivation": "After you have played a predefined number of rounds, the metadata for the images become visible. In this way, you not only generate art-historical knowledge, but also collect it. Every tag you enter is saved and improves the search for artworks—a win-win situation. So, go for it!"
